##Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning
In this project, an artificial intelligence agent that can learn the best strategies in the game of Tic-Tac-Toe was developed using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. The agent completed the learning process by continuously updating a table-based state-value function. The training process went up to 2000 games and 2000 games were simulated. The results showed that our agent's win rate increased over time. The win rate started with 78% in 500 games and increased to 84.9% at the end of 2000 games. These results are evidence that the basic principles of the Reinforcement Learning method can be applied to simple problems and that these basic methods can be considered as an effective approach.
